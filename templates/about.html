                <h2>What is This App?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an educational web application built with Flask (Python) to help students learn about cryptographic algorithms
                    in a hands-on, interactive way. It's designed specifically for Discrete Mathematics courses.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h2>The Ciphers We Explore</h2>
                
                <h3>üèõÔ∏è Caesar Cipher (Fully Implemented)</h3>
                <p>
                    The simplest substitution cipher, used by Julius Caesar. Each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions.
                    <strong>Security:</strong> Very weak - can be broken by trying all 25 possible shifts.
                </p>

                <h3>üîë Vigen√®re Cipher (For You to Implement)</h3>
                <p>
                    Uses a keyword to create multiple Caesar ciphers. Much stronger than Caesar cipher.
                    <strong>Security:</strong> Moderate - can be broken with frequency analysis if the key is short.
                </p>

                <h3>üìê Affine Cipher (For You to Implement)</h3>
                <p>
                    Uses mathematical functions (ax + b) mod 26. Combines multiplication and addition.
                    <strong>Security:</strong> Weak to moderate - vulnerable to frequency analysis.
                </p>

                <h3>üîí RSA Cipher (For You to Implement)</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern public-key cryptography using prime numbers. Used in real-world security today!
                    <strong>Security:</strong> Very strong when implemented with large primes.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    This application is built using:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python with Flask framework</li>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3 (no JavaScript for simplicity)</li>
                    <li><strong>Templating:</strong> Jinja2 (built into Flask)</li>
                    <li><strong>Styling:</strong> Custom CSS with modern design principles</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Why Flask?</strong> Flask is perfect for learning because it's simple, well-documented, 
                    and doesn't hide the underlying web concepts. You can see exactly how HTTP requests and responses work.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h2>Learning Path</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with Caesar Cipher:</strong> Understand the basics of substitution ciphers</li>
                    <li><strong>Implement Vigen√®re:</strong> Learn about polyalphabetic ciphers and keywords</li>
                    <li><strong>Try Affine Cipher:</strong> Explore mathematical functions in cryptography</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge with RSA:</strong> Dive into modern public-key cryptography</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                    Each cipher builds on concepts from the previous ones, creating a natural learning progression
                    from simple to complex encryption methods.
